## Description

This is a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. 

"A **regex**, which is short for **regular expression**, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input."

The specific regular expression that this tutorial will go over is this: `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/` (An email regex)
